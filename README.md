# Reelistic Fishing
Makes fishing rods reel real fish (or other) entities instead of just items. The fishing bobber **must be in open water** to catch fish, otherwise, you'll only get junk items

For adding a custom entity, go visit the datapack's [github repository wiki](https://github.com/eggopacks/reelistic-fishing/wiki) for the whole process

### Uninstallation
To uninstall the datapack, simply run the `eggo.rf:uninstall` function. To completely remove the datapack, delete the **`reelistic_fishing_vX.X.DP.zip`** file located in your *`saves\world_name\datapacks`* folder
